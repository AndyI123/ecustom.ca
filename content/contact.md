Hey! Let us talk. I love communicating with people, I believe discussion is one of the foundations of success within the world.

## Contact

You can email me using the following email address: <lucas@ecustom.ca>. This is the best way to contact me, and as such, the only method which I list.

You can usually expect a response from me in a day or two, if it takes longer than that your message may not have gotten through (spam filter or email malfunction) or I may be composing a response which requires extra time than a quick message.

Please keep the following guidelines in mind when you email me. It makes the conversation much better for both of us.

## Guidelines

When emailing me, please include your name so that I can address you appropriately when responding.

I am open to hearing from people for just about any reason, some of the most common being:

* A project idea
* Hiring me as a developer
* A comment about one of my articles

There are some things I will not tolerate, so if I see any of the following in a message, chances are it will be ignored:

* Any illegal content or discussion
* Any slanderous content
* Anything downright rude or offensive
