Passwords on the web suck. They're either too short to be secure, or too long to remember. Lastpass makes them a lot better by generating and keeping track of them for you. Here's how I use Lastpass to make my password management awesome.

## Setting up Lastpass

Setting up Lastpass couldn't be simpler. Go to their website, click download Lastpass, and follow the instructions.

The install gives you the browser extensions for your browsers of choice, and can import your already saved username-password combinations. I would recommend doing this, and then deleting the saved username-password store in your browser ([Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=95582), [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-passwords#w_viewing-and-deleting-passwords)), because it isn't very secure in your browser.

When creating your account, make sure that you create a master password that is secure. You'll have to remember it (or generate it through another method, such as [SuperGenPass](http://supergenpass.com/)), but it is essentially the key to your digital life so weakness is not an option.

With Lastpass installed and set up, I also strongly recommend that you enable [Google Authenticator](http://helpdesk.lastpass.com/security-options/google-authenticator/) to better protect your account---you'll have to enter an authentication code every so often, but the added security is worth it.

Now that you have Lastpass extra-secure and managing your passwords, let's delve into three of the problems with your old password management, and how Lastpass fixes them.
