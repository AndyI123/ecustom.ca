As this quote by playwright Tom Stoppard suggests, there have been countless technological improvements throughout history. Ironically, however, this quote was from a play set in the mid-early 1900s, certainly a time of technological innovation, but is not today truly the modern age? To be sure, the majority of the innovations of the 1900s were minor, but there were a few gems that pushed forward our society in ways previously thought impossible.

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, access to information as well as general connectivity has improved in leaps and bounds. Five major technological revolutions came about in this time period: the telegraph, telephone, radio, television, and the personal computer. Each one improved upon the previous, opening up new waves of communication and information access.

With each new innovation, came new ways for people to interact with each other. Each offered a distinct new advantage over the previous, some incorporating features that others included, some making up for the lack of features. Take, for instance, the telegram. When it was invented, it was a major improvement over its predecessor, the letter (which still lives on to this day). It offered a way for people to communicate over long distances far swifter than users of letters could ever dream of doing. This connected people in ways that were previously impossible.

Next came the telephone, originally conceived as a complement to telegram services, it became its biggest competitor. The telephone was able to connect people via voice. That personal connection that people got when they picked up the receiver simply blew away the cold, impersonal, typed text of telegrams. That sound and being able to hear people and music over the wire was what gave way to the radio, something which was possibly even more revolutionary.

The radio set that then swept into houses of the &ldquo;common person&rdquo; gave rise to broadcasts of news, music, and entertainment. No longer was access to the news, or more importantly to information, limited to buying a newspaper (if you lived in a city), or waiting for it to trickle down the grapevine (if you lived in the country). All of a sudden, it was available from the family radio set! As Alfred N. Goldsmith, director of research at the RCA put it:

	<blockquote>Whatever he most desires &mdash; whether it be opera, concert, or song, sporting news or jazz, the radio telephone will supply it. And with it, he will be lifted to greater appreciation. We can be certain that a new national cultural appreciation will result.... The people&rsquo;s University of the Air will have a greater student body than all our universities put together.</blockquote>

This, the radio, was a crucial step in making information free and available to more people. It began the transition in changing our &ldquo;modern society&rdquo; mindset to reflect the fact that information was becoming much more readily available. Perhaps, however, the greatest access to information other than the Internet was that of the television, which truly allowed for the common person to learn and act upon information.

With television gaining dominance in the 1960s, it led way to televised coverage of the Vietnam War. Never before had Americans been able to witness the horrors of war from the comfort and safety of their living room. It painted a very unromantic picture of what had once been regarded as the highest honour, to serve one&rsquo;s country, and led to the eventual withdrawal of American troops from the war due to public unrest (<http://www.warbirdforum.com/>). This is a prime example of where technology has influenced humans in such a way that the common person has been able to institute great change. However, what happens when the video and audio capabilities of the television are connected to a device that can not only consume content, but create it as well? The personal computer is born.

The personal computer truly debuted in the 1980s, when it became accessible to all as a content consumption and creation tool. However, it was severely limited in that it could not easily provide access to the vast networks of information that had been created by the radio, telephone and television. It was gleaned that in order for this device to be truly effective, it had to be able to connect to others of its kind, connecting people to people through machine, just as the telegram, telephone, radio and television all did before it.

The telegraph, telephone, radio, television and personal computer are all major innovations that occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries. However, there is one innovation that trumps all the above in providing connectivity and information, and that is the Internet.

Since it became widely available to the public in the 1990s, it has completely revolutionized the modern human. In 2011, nearly a third of the people on Earth (over 2 billion people) connect to the Internet , making it one of the most effective and far-reaching technological innovations of the 20th century. The information that is available on the Internet far surpasses what was available over the wire of days past. People can connect to each other, seeing each other&rsquo;s faces and hearing each other&rsquo;s voice. This, however, is leading to the greatest shift in our mindset since the telegram.

The generation of today, with its access to information and connections like none before it, has a much different mindset to information access than their generational predecessors. However, we as a society are reaching an odd point. Because of how quickly technology is advancing, we have several generational mindsets among us. Those who are used to picking up the telephone, or turning on the television to get their information fix, as well as those who have had computers their whole life. And then there are the generations smushed in-between, where computers were introduced to them later in life, perhaps at university, or in the workplace. These people learned about technology in a different way as well, and use it differently. However, the habits of the younger generations trickle up to the older, thus cycling the mindset of the younger generation.

<h2>Conclusion: Our Changing Mindset</h2>

This mindset, that of constant information access, is our changing mindset. From the generation who had to use the television, and surf through the channels, to find the information they wanted, to the generation that turns on their computer, and opens up a browser to find their information.

This dependence on technology to sate our curiosity is one that has not been so evident in history at any point other than now. However, this dependence is not just on the technology itself, but also upon the human interactions that come with it. The human race is still bound to each other, one way or another, we depend upon each other for our continued existence, and the Internet is the current most used technology for doing that. However, we depend upon the innovators who create these new technologies to create &ldquo;the next Internet&rdquo; or &ldquo;the next radio,&rdquo; something that will once again have a groundbreaking impact on the way we interact with each other, and the way we access our information. However, in doing this, they must ensure that we, as society, do not depend too much upon one another to use this technology, as that could impact us in a way more dangerous than any of the creators imagine.
