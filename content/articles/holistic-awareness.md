A few months ago, my dad and I were out driving. We were coming down into a valley, when he pointed out to me a car dealership situated on the top of the valley wall. He remarked on how, driving down, you could see the dealership and all the cars they had to offer. He complimented the architect for thinking holistically, recognizing all the factors that affected the car dealership, and designing with them in mind.

This lesson is one we should all learn. When we lock ourselves into looking only at one factor, or part, of whatever it is we're working on, we miss out on an opportunity to create a product that is greater than merely the sum of its parts.

// Notes
// Comment on using something like Twitter Bootstrap, but taking some of its elements and throwing them in with what you've already designed. Doesn't work.
