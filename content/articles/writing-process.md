summary: Writing can take place any where... And we need systems that are capable of allowing that to take place. Currently, our best processes are mashups of existing technologies that are often unelegant and crude. We need a system that can take your ideas, which occur everywhere, and allow you to put them in writing for all to see.

<p class="article-intro">
Writing is an art form built on ideas, allowing people to communicate those ideas with each other. However, we know that ideas can strike at any moment. Why, then, is it so hard to write and share your writing at any moment?
</p>

We use writing to share ideas with one another. It makes sense, then, that it should be easy to take your writing and share it with others very quickly. You should also be able to write your ideas down any where, at any time, and have that read by others.

## A growing interest

As a culture, we've become increasingly fascinated with writing over the past few years.

One only needs to look at the explosive popularity of tools like [Twitter](https://twitter.com), whose purpose is to be a "real-time information network", to see that people are flocking to tools allowing for writing and subsequent *sharing* of their writing. Twitter, often called a "microblogging service", excels at allowing people to disseminate small amounts of information to large amounts of people, with little hassle.

[Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) is another great example of a writing tool which makes sharing easy. People love the convenient sharing and the ease with which they can start writing.

Finally, look at the recent successes of [Medium](https://medium.com), which allows people to "share ideas and stories that are longer than 140 characters and not just for friends." People are recognizing the value of being able to write their ideas and share them, quickly exposing them to a huger audience than if they were to share their ideas with friends only.

We see the trends within writing moving from writing to disseminate information privately (think letters and emails), to writing that shares itself with the world. Writing is now public, and the onus is on us to produce tools that makes that public writing process as painless as possible.

## The tools of writing

The process of writing can happen any time, any place; because ideas come to us at any time or in any place. The tools that enable us to write, then, should not be limited by the time or place in which we choose to write our ideas.

Additionally, we should be able to use the tools we want to use. I should be able to write in one tool, and continue writing in another, with as little transition possible.

For example, let's look at the tools I use in my writing workflow (which does not meet the ideals necessary to achieve our writing goals):

1. An idea comes to me. This could be in the shower, on the bus, or late at night as I toss and turn.

2. I write my idea down. The idea gets stored in whatever medium is convenient at the time, whether it's my Moleskine that I carry around, or in Google Keep, or on the back of my hand.

3. If I have time, I start fleshing out further ideas around the idea. This usually manifests itself in random sentences which represent the core thoughts I wish to share.

4. Later, I'll return to my ideas and start writing in a large notebook or typing my thoughts on my trusty [Thinkpad T42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_T_Series) (I use it almost exclusively for writing, because the keyboard is so damn good). This step is the one that often causes trouble for me, because the thoughts and inspiration surrounding me when I originally had the idea are no longer present, so I have much difficulty in writing my idea out in a way that befits my original passion.

5. I'll then edit my writing, usually by passing it off to a friend and then reading it over myself.

6. Next, I'll publish the piece. Almost all my writing is published on this website, while I also decide to cross-publish some of the pieces on [Medium](https://medium.com). This publishing step has a deceptive number of substeps if I'm publishing to my site, due to the way my publishing system is set up. More on that later.

7. Finally, I'll start promoting the piece on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lchski), Facebook, and by word of mouth (yep, that's still a useful method in our online world).

This process works okay (it's resulting in this article, isn't it?), but there's a few key issues with it which hold it back from being the ideal writing system:

* This system isn't very good at *sharing ideas*. There's no incentive for people to share, and there's no built in large audience who will read my work.

* This system doesn't allow for actually writing and publishing the entire article from anywhere. I'm still tied down to using a computer with specialized software to publish my pieces.

* The idea can go cold. This ties into the previous point. Because I can't write my entire article and then share it from anywhere, I'm limited in my "window of passion." I have to make the most of very limited tools to write down my thoughts once I come upon an idea, and that often isn't enough to craft a good piece of art before the idea disappears from my mind.
