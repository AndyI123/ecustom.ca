summary: Writing can take place any where... And we need systems that are capable of allowing that to take place. Currently, our best processes are mashups of existing technologies that are often unelegant and crude. We need a system that can take your ideas, which occur everywhere, and allow you to put them in writing for all to see.

<p class="article-intro">
Writing is an art form built on ideas, allowing people to communicate those ideas with each other. However, we know that ideas can strike at any moment. Why, then, is it so hard to write and share your writing at any moment?
</p>

We use writing to share ideas with one another. It makes sense, then, that it should be easy to take your writing and share it with others very quickly. You should also be able to write your ideas down any where, at any time, and have that read by others.

## A growing interest

As a culture, we've become increasingly fascinated with writing over the past few years.

One only needs to look at the explosive popularity of tools like [Twitter](https://twitter.com), whose purpose is to be a "real-time information network", to see that people are flocking to tools allowing for writing and subsequent *sharing* of their writing. Twitter, often called a "microblogging service", excels at allowing people to disseminate small amounts of information to large amounts of people, with little hassle.

[Tumblr](https://tumblr.com) is another great example of a writing tool which makes sharing easy. People love the convenient sharing and the ease with which they can start writing.

Finally, look at the recent successes of [Medium](https://medium.com), which allows people to "share ideas and stories that are longer than 140 characters and not just for friends." People are recognizing the value of being able to write their ideas and share them, quickly exposing them to a huger audience than if they were to share their ideas with friends only.

We see the trends within writing moving from writing to disseminate information privately (think letters and emails), to writing that shares itself with the world. Writing is now public, and the onus is on us to produce tools that makes that public writing process as painless as possible.

## The tools of writing

The process of writing can happen any time, any place; because ideas come to us at any time or in any place. The tools that enable us to write, then, should not be limited by the time or place in which we choose to write our ideas.

Additionally, we should be able to use the tools we want to use. I should be able to write in one tool, and continue writing in another, with as little transition possible.

## The ideal tool of writing

The tool we need for writing, then, has to allow for a few key things.

Our tool needs to allow for the entire article creation process.
