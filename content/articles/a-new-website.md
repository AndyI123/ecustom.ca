summary: Ahh.... Can you smell the new-website smell? After a long, long, long time, I've finally crafted the new version of ecustom.ca, now my personal website. This is the official announcement article.

This is it. The new version of ecustom.ca. One could call it version 3.0, after several major iterations previous, but I prefer to think of it as version 1.0.

With this new ecustom.ca, I am moving on from my previous delusions of grandeur in using the website as a selling point for my business. Now, ecustom.ca represents me, and me alone, as my personal website. With that, I am moving my branding away from one of a company style to one where I am the brand. I feel this is the best way to move forward.

I may migrate some of my posts over from the old ecustom.ca, but that remains to be seen based on what I believe to be the quality of those articles not fitting in with the new standards I am setting for myself here.

With that said, I plan to publish some good pieces of journalism, from objective essays to more personal, emotional pieces. I know that I have plenty of great content planned; the test will be how regularly I will be able to create and share it.

Expect a coming post detailing the technology powering the website, as well as a more detailed history of ecustom.ca throughout the past few years.

With all that said, welcome to my new home! Feel free to send me comments and feedback through my [contact page](/contact/ "Contact Me"). Cheers!
