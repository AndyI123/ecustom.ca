<p class="article-intro">
My writing workflow has evolved considerably over the past few years, going from zero in 2010, to where I am today. This evolution is largely due to the changing tools I use to publish and promote my writing, in addition to the type of writing I try to put out.

## My writing workflow

My writing workflow currently works for me, but it falls short 

1. An idea comes to me. This could be in the shower, on the bus, or late at night as I toss and turn.

2. I write my idea down. The idea gets stored in whatever medium is convenient at the time, whether it's my Moleskine that I carry around, or in Google Keep, or on the back of my hand.

3. If I have time, I start fleshing out further ideas around the idea. This usually manifests itself in random sentences which represent the core thoughts I wish to share.

4. Later, I'll return to my ideas and start writing in a large notebook or typing my thoughts on my trusty [Thinkpad T42](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_T_Series) (I use it almost exclusively for writing, because the keyboard is so damn good). This step is the one that often causes trouble for me, because the thoughts and inspiration surrounding me when I originally had the idea are no longer present, so I have much difficulty in writing my idea out in a way that befits my original passion.

5. I'll then edit my writing, usually by passing it off to a friend and then reading it over myself.

6. Next, I'll publish the piece. Almost all my writing is published on this website, while I also decide to cross-publish some of the pieces on [Medium](https://medium.com). This publishing step has a deceptive number of substeps if I'm publishing to my site, due to the way my publishing system is set up. More on that later.

7. Finally, I'll start promoting the piece on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lchski), Facebook, and by word of mouth (yep, that's still a useful method in our online world).

This process works okay (it's resulting in this article, isn't it?), but there's a few key issues with it which hold it back from being the ideal writing system:

* This system isn't very good at *sharing ideas*. There's no incentive for people to share, and there's no built in large audience who will read my work.

* This system doesn't allow for actually writing and publishing the entire article from anywhere. I'm still tied down to using a computer with specialized software to publish my pieces.

* The idea can go cold. This ties into the previous point. Because I can't write my entire article and then share it from anywhere, I'm limited in my "window of passion." I have to make the most of very limited tools to write down my thoughts once I come upon an idea, and that often isn't enough to craft a good piece of art before the idea disappears from my mind.

* The actual publishing process (step 6) is a major pain. Now, this is largely self-inflicted due to my insistence on using [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws) to publish instead of a dynamic system like [WordPress](http://wordpress.org); but it helps to illustrate the point that a good writing process, and thus a good writing system, should be easy to publish from.

My process (and largely the publishing part of it) does allow for a few niceties, though, which other systems do not:

* I have control over the location of all my content, and can access it at any time. Because my content resides entirely in either: (a) sheets of paper in my notebooks, or (b) plaintext files on my computers, I control where it is. I don't have to worry about exporting it from a company who may or may not allow that in the future... I already have it with me.

* I have control over the presentation. Good ideas require good presentation to accompany them, in order to best *communicate* them to their audience. Great ideas can be communicated via unstyled HTML just fine, but we've come to expect a higher quality from the information we read today.

This system works fine. However, it can be improved to create a writing system that's truly modern, one that works for a variety of workflows and adapts itself --- instead of forcing us to adapt to it.
