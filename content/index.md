<h2><a href="/about/" title="About Me">About Me</a></h2>

I am Lucas Cherkewski, a student, a developer, and a [geek/nerd](http://xkcd.com/747/ "xkcd: Geeks and Nerds"). A lover of open-source, the power of data, and public transit. An appreciator of &ldquo;old&rdquo; music, of simplicity, and of great food. My heroes are the people through history who have stuck to their beliefs, no matter the cost, and the people who toil to make the lives of others better without appreciation. You can read up some more about me on my [page About Me](/about/ "About Me").
