<h1 class="article-title">Terms and Conditions</h1>

<p class="article-intro">These terms and conditions apply to all projects undertaken by Lucas Cherkewski for clients.</p>

Payment of invoices should occur no longer than 30 days after invoices have been issued. A cheque written out by name to "Lucas Cherkewski" is preferred.

Extra costs incurred during the project by usage of third-party services, such as registering domains or hosting, or purchase of third-party products, such as buying a WordPress plugin, are passed on directly to the client at no extra cost.

After completion of the project, clients own (where applicable) the resulting deliverable in its entirety. However, clients grant license to Lucas Cherkewski to use their work as examples of his past work.
