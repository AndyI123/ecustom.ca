title: 404! Oops, that's an error!

<h2 class="section-header">Yikes!</h2>

The page you were looking for seems to be hiding. I can't find it, at least. This is what's called a 404 Not Found error, and they kind of suck.

Maybe you'd like to help me out by <a href="/contact/">dropping me a line</a> to tell me about this problem? A quick email or Tweet letting me know about the problem should make life much easier for others in the future. Thanks!
