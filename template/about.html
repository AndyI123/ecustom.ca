			<h1>About Me</h1>

			<p>What makes me who I am? Who am I? What do I do with my life?</p>
			
			<h2>A Student, Developer, and <a href="http://xkcd.com/747/" title="xkcd: Geeks and Nerds">Nerd/Geek</a></h2>
			
			<p>I am a full-time student. It can be a big commitment, and I do not always enjoy it, but the rewards reaped from it are numerous.</p>
			
			<p>Aside from being a full-time student, I am also a part-time developer. Well, more of a free-time developer. I create websites for small businesses in my area, working out the best solutions to the problems they face. I also dabble in contest programming, and in studying various other aspects of Computer Science.</p>
			
			<p>Also, I am a nerd/geek. I am a &ldquo;techy guy&rdquo; who knows how to solve people&rsquo;s everyday computing problems. In all actuality, I just know how to use Google effectively - but nobody has to know that that is really the case. I have many side pursuits which could be viewed as nerdy or geeky, such as playing with Linux or trying to make an algorithm more efficient. I enjoy it all, though, and it is one of those things which keeps me going.</p>
			
			<h2>Open-Source, the Power of Data, and Public Transit</h2>
			
			<p>Open-Source Software (<abbr title="Open-Source Software">OSS</abbr>) is a personal passion of mine. I love the communities that sprout up around various <abbr title="Open-Source Software">OSS</abbr> projects, and I do my best to contribute to them when I can. To that end, I make software and code I produce freely available on <a href="https://github.com/asdfgh746" title="GitHub: asdfgh746 (Lucas Cherkewski)">my GitHub account</a>.</p>
			
			<p>The availability of data today poses some interesting questions and challenges. How private should the data be? Who should have access to what data? I am a believer in data being free and open for all, because of the power we as a society unlock by having access to that data and being able to manipulate and analyze it.</p>
			
			<p>Public transit is another interest of mine. I find it fascinating how a person could conceivably live much of their lives without having to drive a vehicle of their own, provided that their area of residence and workplace has access to a good public transit system. I believe we should do more to connect different metropolitan areas, and to promote the benefits of public transit. In the end, it would be better for all.</p>
			
			<h2>&ldquo;Old&rdquo; Music, Good Food, and Simplicity are Best</h2>

			<p>I listen to all sorts of music in my day. From Guns N' Roses to Beethoven to ADELE, I appreciate numerous different genres. However, the kind I connect to most is not the kind which my friends listen to, but rather the music of my parents' generation, and the music before. Some of my favourite artists/groups are (in no particular order):</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Billy Idol</li>
				<li>The Beatles</li>
				<li>Guns N' Roses</li>
				<li>Bon Jovi</li>
				<li>Queen</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>As one could see, I listen to all sorts of different music and I appreciate it all for what it is. What I do not appreciate is those who denounce music simply because it is &ldquo;old&rdquo; or not popular with everybody else who they hang out with. I do my best to get past those misconceptions, and to listen to and appreciate the music I love.</p>
			
			<p>Good food is something which I have been extremely fortunate to grow up around. My parents have always ensured that I have good, healthy, tasty food available to me, from my mom's delicious meatloaf to my dad's kick-ass ribs. Fantastic food is special to me, as it is often what has brought my family (both immediate and extended) together. My nonna's hearty servings of pasta, made from only the freshest tomatoes, and my oma's delicate fish preparations will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
			
			<p>Simplicity. I believe in keeping things simple and easily understandable. We should not clutter up our lives with unnecessary items, instead operating with what we need and with what truly makes our lives better.</p>
			
			<h2>Heroes</h2>
			
			<p>My heroes are the unspoken ones. The ones who toil behind the scenes to make the lives of others better, with little to no recognition. It is one of my goals in life to recognize these people and to bring them to light, to grant them the recognition they deserve. After all, without these people, our lives would not be the same.</p>
